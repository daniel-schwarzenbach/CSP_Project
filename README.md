# Introduction

This repository contains the code to simulate the 3D Heisenberg model using
different algorithms. The 3D Heisenberg model is a lattice model that
is used to understand the behavior of magnetic materials under various
conditions. The three algorithms implemented for the simulation are the Wolff
algorithm, the standard Metropolis algorithm and an adaptive version
of the Metropolis algorithm.

In this README file we give instructions for the installation of the
required libraries, provide an overview over the code, describe the
core difference between the three algorithms implemented and give a 
brief overview over the results that can be obtained using our code. 
Finally, we list the contributions.

# Algorithms

## Metropolis

The Metropolis algorithm explores the phase space of the system by proposing
spin flips, based on a specified trial move, and accepts them based on the
energy difference between the two configurations. We implemented three
different trial moves: the spin flip, the small step and the random step, which
are member functions of the spin class. The implementation allows applying an 
external magnetic field as well as a magnetic anisotropy. More information
about the algorithm can be found [here](https://www.aliquote.org/pub/metropolis-et-al-1953.pdf).

## Adaptive Metropolis

The adaptive Metropolis is an extension of the standard Metropolis algorithm,
that is based on a different trial move, with an adaptive elememt. This 
enhances the sampling efficieny and keeps the acceptance rate close to
fifty percent. As for the standard Metropolis, the implementation allows applying an 
external magnetic field as well as a magnetic anisotropy. A detailed description can be found 
[here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-648X/aaf852/meta).

## Wolff

The Wolff algorithm is a cluster update algorithm, that flips entire cluster
contrary to the Metropolis algorithm, which flips individual spins. The 
cluster is build succesively from a randomly chosen site and flipped at
the end of each step. This approach accelerates the exploration of the 
phase space, especially near critical points, making it ideal for studying
phase transitions. More information can be found [here](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.62.361).

# Results

The code can be used to demonstrate that all algorithms guide an intial spin
configuration towards thermal equilibrium. Notably, for all algorithms,
the value of the observables at equilibirum agree. Simulations show 
a clear phase transition from a magnetized phase at low temperatures to 
a demagnetized phase at high temperatures and the critical exponents 
can be calculated. Additionally, the effect of an external magnetic
field and spatial anisotropies can be observed.

In the following plot, we can observe a phase transition as shown by the order parameter $M$ for $L = 8$. The data was calculated using the Metropolis algorithm.

The time per algorithm step is constant for the Metropolis algorithm, as expected...

... however, for the Monte Carlo steps, we observe an increase over several orders of magnitude. This is known as the critical slowing down of the dynamics:
